sudo apt install maven

mvn clean install

cd target

java -jar jar_xxx.jar



Decided to use Maven as a basic framework as it is both simple and effective, quick to get a small project off the ground.


Done my best to honour the time frame. Seems like a tight time frame in retrospect. Focused on getting the core functionality developed and tested!

Many thanks, Chris.
